# Daily Closeout

Use the gtd-workflow skill to review your day and prepare for tomorrow.

**This command triggers the Daily Closeout Workflow from the gtd-workflow skill.**

---

## What This Does

The gtd-workflow skill will:
1. **First:** Check inbox (prompts to process if 5+ items)
2. Review today's plan and accomplishments
3. Mark completed/partial/deferred tasks
4. Capture unplanned work
5. Ask about tomorrow's priorities
6. Generate tomorrow's DRAFT plan (without energy/context - you'll refine with /daily-plan in the morning)
7. Update _Context.md

---

## How to Use

Just run this command or say:
- "Review my day"
- "Daily closeout"
- "How did I do today"
- "Prepare for tomorrow"

The gtd-workflow skill will automatically load, check your inbox first, and guide you through the closeout process.
