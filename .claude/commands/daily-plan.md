# Daily Plan

Use the gtd-workflow skill to plan your day.

**This command triggers the Daily Plan Workflow from the gtd-workflow skill.**

## What This Does

The gtd-workflow skill will:
1. **First:** Check inbox (prompts to process if 5+ items)
2. Gather intelligence from all active projects and areas
3. Ask about your context, energy, time, and deadlines (GTD four criteria)
4. Generate prioritized action list (must-do, should-do, quick wins)
5. Create daily plan file
6. Update _Context.md with today's focus

---

## How to Use

Just run this command or say:
- "Plan my day"
- "What should I work on today"
- "Help me prioritize"
- "Create today's plan"

The gtd-workflow skill will automatically load, check your inbox first, and guide you through the planning process.
