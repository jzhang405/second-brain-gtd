# Process Inbox

Use the gtd-workflow skill to process your inbox.

**This command triggers the Process Inbox Workflow from the gtd-workflow skill.**

## What This Does

The gtd-workflow skill will:
1. Scan your inbox locations for unprocessed items
2. Ask clarifying questions for any vague captures
3. Apply GTD clarifying questions to each item
4. Determine priority (high/next/someday)
5. Route items to appropriate locations (projects, areas, relationships)
6. Review all active projects (quick health check)
7. Update your system state (_Context.md)

---

## How to Use

Just run this command or say:
- "Process my inbox"
- "Organize my captures"
- "Clarify inbox items"
- "Get to inbox zero"

The gtd-workflow skill will automatically load and guide you through the complete process.
